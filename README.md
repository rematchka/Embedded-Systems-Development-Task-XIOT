I dont know how to setup it using sand box so there is no documentation for it. There exist on problem is that i dont know when to print led is on or off as it wasnt clear in , so i print led on or off when state changes . Another assumption is that im using Grove - Temperature Sensor.
If you want to setup on Arduino connect temperature sensor to A5 and switch to pin 2,led to pin 13.
connect Vcc,Gnd .
connect arduino to your computer upload code ,well its working.
